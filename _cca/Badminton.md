The JWPS Badminton Club provides members with opportunities to learn the proper skills and further develop their passion for the sport. Our training sessions are focused on improving technique, stamina, strength and character of our students. The guidance of the dedicated teachers and coach has enabled our boys to clinch the ‘West Zone Top 4’ position in 2022.

<br>

In the course of nurturing future sportsmen and pursuing sporting excellence, we aim to inculcate in our students leadership, sportsmanship as well as our school values -- Teamwork, Honesty, Innovativeness, Kindness, Enthusiasm and Resilience -- through the activities during CCA.
