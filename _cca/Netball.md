Netball is an exciting, fast and skillful game that not only requires good teamwork and stamina, but also quick and flexible thinking in order to strategize effective gameplay. In JWPS, our goal is to develop our studentsâ€™ passion for the sport, and to nurture a sense of camaraderie among netballers.
<br>

Netball trainings are conducted weekly by experienced coaches where students will learn the basics of the game like playing positions, passing, shooting, defending, and footwork drills.
