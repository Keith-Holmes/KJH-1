Chinese Dance is a well-established performing arts group in JWPS. Our objective is to cultivate studentsâ€™ passion for dance and art, and at the same time, to let them have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture.

<br>

Apart from performing for school events, students are given the opportunity to perform at the biannual Singapore Youth Festival as well as many other community events, such as the Pioneer Community Club's Open House. Through performing on stage, students learn to express themselves with grace and elegance and become a more confident person.
