Art Club is for students who are interested in art and crafts. It encourages students to express their creativity and art ideas in their art-making processes by drawing on their own experiences and external resources.

<br>

Different art forms are introduced in order to develop students' skills in various art genres. They encompasses different media such as drawing, painting, printmaking, decorative arts, photography, sculptures and installation.&nbsp; Art Club also allows students to demonstrate school values, develop their socio-emotional learning (SEL) competencies, and grow into confident 21st century young artists.
