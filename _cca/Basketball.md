“I think, team first. It allows me to succeed, it allows my team to succeed.”

<br>

***Lebron James***

<br>

Basketball is a dynamic, fun and enjoyable sport that requires endurance, competence and team spirit to outscore other teams and win the game.
<br>

Basketball trains you in physical skills such as running and jumping, dribbling, aiming and shooting, stealing the ball or getting a rebound. It also teaches you the importance of team spirit and teamwork, as you need to cooperate and communicate with your team in order to win the game.
<br>

Apart from physical fitness and skills, you will also learn to develop the mental acuity required to observe the flow of the game to know when and how to position yourself during a match. There are always new ways to play the game and Basketball is the place to be if you want to have fun, be healthy and fit and make new friends along the way.
