*All the worldâ€™s a stage,*

*And all the men and women merely players*

*They have their exits and entrances*

*And one man in his time plays many parts.*

***As You Like It, William Shakespeare***

The JWPS Drama Club takes our members into the world of the Performing Arts and seeks to inspire creativity and unleash the potential of budding writers and thespians. From script-writing to oratory skills to prop-making, members will draw on the experience of others and tap on vivid imagination to prepare and perform skits. Not only will members be able to explore literary interests and tune in to the wonderful world of music and lyrics, they will also be presented with opportunities to work collaboratively, develop leadership skills as well as hone socio-emotional competencies.
