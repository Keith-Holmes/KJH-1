Hip Hop CCA is a performing arts group in Jurong West Primary School. The CCA aims to cultivate the passion for dance in the students. At the same time, we hope to build studentsâ€™ self-confidence and self-esteem. The students will learn about elements of hip hop dance culture, dance techniques and skills. Students will have the opportunity to learn choreographies and perform for events such as Singapore Youth Festival, school and community events.
