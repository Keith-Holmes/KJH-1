JWPS Track &amp; Field is a sport that is both an individual and team sport, requiring students to compete against their own personal bests as well as against their opponents. In this CCA the students compete in a variety of track events, such as sprints, middle-distance running, hurdling, relays, and field events like shot put, javelin and different types of jumps. Each event requires different techniques and strategies to be successful. It is a sport that rewards skill, speed, technique, and endurance. It is an exciting sport, with plenty of opportunities to compete, improve, and excel.
