The Scouting's purpose is to help young people to develop their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities as individuals and as members of the society. We aim to contribute to the society by rising to the occasion for National Events. Through equipping ourselves with core skills like Pioneering, Orienteering and Interpersonal skills, our learning never stops.
<br>

Our Mission is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law: *To help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society*.
<br>

Our CCA Activities include Annual Camps, Outdoor Cooking, Campfires, Value-In-Action â€“ initiated by the scouts and more. 
<br>

Our Achievements include the Frank Cooper Sands Award (Gold) 2022.
