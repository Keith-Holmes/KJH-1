# Special Educational Needs (SEN) Support for students

The school adopts a Tiered System of Support (TSS) in providing support to students with special educational and/ or additional needs. Each student’s performance and progress is used and reviewed to determine the level of needs and intensity of support required. The TSS helps with effective and efficient allocation of resources in the areas of manpower, time, physical space and finances.

### **SEN Officers**

SEN Officers provide support to students in need of additional support in their learning and/ or behavior. They will carry out the following:

1) Conduct in-class observations on students who need or had been identified as needing additional support in class
2) Provide consultation to teachers and parents on supporting the needs of the students
3) Liaise with MOE Psychologists or external organizations in providing assessments on the needs of the students
4) Provide in-class support, withdrawal sessions or after school support to the students in need
5) Plan and implement individualized/ group intervention (e.g. social skills training, confidence-building, literacy and numeracy support)
6) Work closely with the CMT in supporting the students
