2015 新年庆祝会
==========

<p style="text-align: justify;">18th February was a joyous date for all staff, visiting parents and students of Jurong West Primary School as a grand celebration heralded the Chinese Lunar New Year. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> This year, the celebration began with a sing-along session led by our very own music teachers along with a group of vocally talented students. This was followed by an impressive drum performance that truly left the audience yearning for more. To top this performance, the highlight of the day- four nimble footed lion dancers, showcased their acrobatic moves that left many students with mouths gaping wide in amazement. Even the stage was too small for these professional lion dancers as they proceeded along the aisles of the hall where students were allowed to touch the elaborate lion costumes. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Games were also played where teacher-student pairs were formed to compete against each other- much to the delight of the audience, many of whom cheered for their favourite teacher or friend. As part of Lunar New Year customs, oranges were also given out by Mrs Yap, the principal, to all staff of Jurong West Primary School. May the year bring great fortune, luck and good results to all indeed! </p>
