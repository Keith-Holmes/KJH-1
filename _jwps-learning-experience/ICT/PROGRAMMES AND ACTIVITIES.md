# PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES

### IMDA Lab on Wheels

<p style="text-align: justify;">On 4 and 5 July 2017, our Primary 5 students participated in the IMDA Lab on Wheels activity for the second consecutive year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This year, the students had the opportunity to try simple coding and work the Ozobot Robot under the guidance of our IMDA instructors. Designed to be experiential and engaging, the ICT activities conducted on the bus aim to spark students' interest in studying technology. Through this activity, students also developed logical thinking and problem-solving skills. They learned basic drag-and-drop coding to control their Ozobot Robot and eventually used it to solve trigonometry problems. The activity was well-received by students, with 98% of them finding the workshop fun and interesting, and they expressed their interest in trying out other coding activities at home by themselves. Overall, it was a meaningful and fruitful time for the students who attended the IMDA Lab on Wheels activity.</p>

### Mobile Computer Labs  


Our computer labs have gone mobile!

<p style="text-align: justify;">Conventionally, students were brought to the computer labs for ICT lessons but since 2017, we have made our computer labs mobile and we are now bringing computer labs to the students in the classrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This initiative greatly reduces the time and hassle of bringing students from the classrooms to the computer labs, which could typically take ten to fifteen minutes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ICT learning can now take place beyond the boundaries of the four walls of a lab. In fact, it can take place anywhere around the school! Let us take a look at some of the lessons conducted using our Mobile Computer Labs.</p>

### Annual E-Learning Exercise

<p style="text-align: justify;">The E-Learning Exercise for Primary 1 to Primary 6 students is conducted twice every year. This exercise is conducted to prepare our students in the event of an emergency which may lead to school closure. Each exercise is held over a duration of two days on our E-Learning portal ([http://www.mconline.sg](http://www.mconline.sg/)).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In these two days, students will be required to complete work assigned for all subjects, namely English, Mathematics, Mother Tongue and Science (for Primary 3, 4, 5 and 6 students only). Students who do not have computer or internet access at home may obtain permission to return to school on these two days at a specific time to complete his/her assignments.</p>
