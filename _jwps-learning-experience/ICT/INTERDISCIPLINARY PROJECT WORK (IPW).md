# INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT WORK (IPW)

*   We use IPW for P3 to P5 students as a signature programme for Character and Development Education.
*   The themes for each level are carefully selected to align to the NE messages.
*   We integrate Social Studies, English, Health Education, Community Involvement Programmes (CIP) and Learning Journey into our IPW.
*   Our purpose is to help students to find meaning and relevance in the projects that they are assigned to do.
