## APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP)

### Art of Communication for Personal Excellence

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school believes in the potential of ALP to help it realise its school mission and vision. The school is cognisant of the growing demands and expectations of having students who are future ready and well anchored on sound moral values. As such, ALP is poised to bring about these two aspects which are also incidentally encapsulated in our mission statement. </p>

### Outcomes of ALP

*   <span style="text-align: justify;">To reaise confident communicators and creative individuals who are well anchored on the school core values and capable to lead self and others; and </span>
*   <span style="text-align: justify;">To ensure the pervasiveness and sustainability of ALP via infusion into the school-based curriculum, namely PAL, NE and IPW. </span>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In line with the <b>G</b>i<b>FT</b> approach in student development, the school has been very focused and comprehensive in its first tier of <b>G</b>eneral student development via ALP. In the area of <b>F</b>ocused Training, the school will further streamline its processes in identifying the potential students for Tier 2 development. In the case of <b>T</b>alent management, the school will be looking at possible platforms for the students to be further stretched in their potential via school ambassadorship. </p>

## DIGITAL STORYTELLING (DST)

### Alignment with the MOE English Syllabus

<p style="text-align: justify;"> DST was launched in response to the fast-changing and multi-faceted way of learning in the educational landscape. The programme was aligned to the school’s vision and mission and ICT was employed extensively. To quote Michael Fullen, “Pedagogy is the driver. Technology is the accelerator." We hope to deepen and enhance the writing processes of the students, as well as make writing a pleasurable experience for them. DST is not an add-on. Instead, it is meant as a complement to the school's STELLAR writing programme in alignment with the MOE English Syllabus. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Through DST, the school hopes to enhance competencies across many domains, and expose teachers and students to the possibilities of using Web2.0 tools for teaching and learning. A number of teaching periods were allocated to DST in the Primary 3 English curriculum. Through DST, our students learnt to use tools such as Google Slides, Google Documents, Linoit and PowerPoint to write and share about their experiences. As a form of self-directed learning, students were taught features of recount writing and encouraged to create their own digital stories. </p>

## ENGLISH STUDENT LEADERS

### Developing Leadership Potential

<p style="text-align: justify;"> At the start of the school year, English Leaders will go through a short training on their roles and responsibilities. English Leaders are the first-line support to their English teacher. They will help to collect homework and assist in any English-related activities. This year, the leaders had the opportunity to present stories and grammar items to their classmates weekly. This provided a platform for the leaders to share their newfound grammar knowledge. By presenting in front of their peers, the leaders also developed greater confidence and knowledge of grammar items. Primary 5 and Primary 6 leaders took it one step further and shared moral stories with Primary 1 and 2 students. </p>


## LEARNING SUPPORT PROGRAMME (LSP)

### Early Literacy Intervention for Primary 1 and 2 Students

<p style="text-align: justify;"> LSP is an early literacy intervention programme which aims to provide learning support to Primary 1 and 2 students who have weak language, reading and spelling skills. They are identified for this programme through the Early Literacy Indicators Test which is administered at the beginning of Primary 1. The students are taught by the LSCs, Mrs Margaret Tan and Mrs Farihin, in groups of ten for one period every day. The curriculum includes the teaching of phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, reading and spelling skills. The students are given much support and encouragement and are taught in a conducive and well-decorated classroom. At the end of the year, students who meet the twin-discharge criteria, namely age-appropriate reading age and a pass in overall English Language, are discharged from the programme. They are awarded certificates of achievement for attaining a pass in the English Language and making progress in their reading. </p>

### Learning Support Games Day

<p style="text-align: justify;"> All Primary 1 and Primary 2 LSP students will have a chance to participate in creative and fun activities on the annual Learning Support Games Day. They play phonics games and also engage in team-building activities during the event. </p>

## LITERATURE PROGRAMME

### Enjoyment of Reading and Language Learning

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Our school embarked on the Literature Programme for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students in 2016. Through this programme, we hope to instil the love of reading in our students. The books, _Charlotte’s Web_ and _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_, have very interesting plots and characters that provide opportunities for engaging classroom discussions. Such discussions include values on friendship, kindness, compassion and generosity. Students often are able to link real life experiences to the story, hence making the whole process meaningful. The classroom activities also explore creative expressions in the form of poetry writing and poster design. The learning of English language is thus seamlessly weaved into this programme. We hope that through the guidance of the English teachers and the learning experience they gain from the programme, students are better skilled and are able to enjoy in greater depths the books that they pick up to read in future. </p>

## READING CULTURE LIBRARY

### Cultivating Love for Reading

<p style="text-align: justify;"> We hope to innovate constantly and develop a cosy and conducive library for our students to lure them to the world of books. Stories are told very often and students are introduced to popular authors in the library. The library has very colourful thematic book displays to encourage them to explore books based on those themes. Library readership is monitored monthly and certificates are given out to students and classes with the highest readership. To inculcate the habit of reading, the school has implemented a few initiatives. Students are encouraged to read extensively and badges are given out every month to readers as rewards to inspire them. Besides role modelling by teachers, a group of enthusiastic parents lends their support to our school reading journey by being “parentellers”. They share stories regularly with students during recesses. Thus far, they have been very well received as their presentations were often engaging. The school hopes to extend the reading experiences in our school by collaborating with the National Library Board to bring in more engaging and enriching library programmes for our students. </p>

## SCHOOL-BASED DYSLEXIA REMEDIATION PROGRAMME (SDR)

### Explicit Teaching of Phonemic Awareness, Reading Recognition and Comprehension

<p style="text-align: justify;"> SDR is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students It is conducted specially for students diagnosed with Dyslexia as the development of reading and spelling skills in these students are delayed and thus, they will benefit from smaller group teaching. SDR explicitly teaches phonemic awareness, higher reading recognition and comprehension within a controlled group. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for Dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. In JWPS, this programme conducted on every Tuesday to Thursday for one hour throughout the whole year. Following a two-year programme, students display a vast improvement in reading and understanding comprehension skills. They are also able to practise the comprehension skills taught in their own learning. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. At the end every term, a progress report is given to each student and his or her progress and achievements are communicated to their parents. </p>

## VALUES EDUCATION

### Imparting of Values

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Values education is the process by which teachers impart moral values to the young minds of JWPS students. In JWPS, we give utmost importance to instilling values through English lessons. We explicitly teach students on values through stories read in class, videos on values, interaction between teachers and students on the values taught and reflection activities at the end of the lesson. In JWPS, we already impart our school values, RISE (Respect, Integrity, Self-discipline and Excellence), throughout the whole journey of their primary years in JWPS. Values education is an advancement to the existing values taught in school. Values Education is incorporated into English lessons. Posters on different values are also put up around the school and in the classrooms so that students will always have a visual reminder on the values taught to them. </p>
