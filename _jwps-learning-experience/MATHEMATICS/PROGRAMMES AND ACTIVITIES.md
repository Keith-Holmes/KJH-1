## INFUSING GAMES AND ACTIVITIES IN OUR MATH LESSONS    
### Games Infusion

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The department believes in using games and hands-on activities to engage our students in the process of active learning. As part of the school’s effort to create a conducive learning environment for all students, our teachers have been incorporating hands-on activities using Math manipulatives in the delivery of our lessons. The use of simple and colourful manipulatives such as Play Money, Fraction discs, interlocking cubes etc, promotes students’ engagement and participation in the learning process. Opportunities are provided for students to discover, process and apply new information to make their learning authentic. </p>

### Math Games Week

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In Term 3, our students are provided with a platform to play competitively against their peers in the annual Math Games Week. Games such as Numero, Math Warrior and Fun with Tangrams provide a meaningful situation for the application of Mathematical skills. Through games, students are motivated to participate and enjoy playing. In the process, students build their confidence and develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics, reducing the fear of failures and errors. </p>

WIRELESS EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
------------------------------

  

### 

Bringing Authentic Context to Learning

In line with the department's beliefs of using hands-on activities to engage our students in the process of active learning, every Primary 4 student will have the opportunity to participate in Wireless Experiential Learning. Students will work in groups and solve problems in a real-world context and learn to explore mathematical ideas in depth. The activity aims to help students make meaningful connections between their learning and the real world, use technology to help them in their problem-solving and, most importantly, find joy in the learning of Mathematics.

FUNDAMATICS
-----------

###   

### 

Strengthening the Fundamentals by Having Fun with Mathematics

As part of the school's initiative of implementing an active recess, the Mathematics Department has introduced an activity named FUNdamatics. FUNdamatics provides another channel for pupils to be actively and meaningfully occupied during recess through playing mathematical and logical games. The main objective of this activity is to instill fun in the process of our students' learning through the use of mathematical and logical games. The games have been carefully curated with the aim of improving students’ mathematical factual fluency. Also, our teachers hope to cultivate in students a greatest interest and love for the subject.

MATH OLYMPIAD
-------------

### 

  

Stretching Students' Potential and Achieving Greater Heights

Math Olympiad is an enrichment programme for selected Primary 4 to Primary 6 students with high aptitude and interest in Mathematics. It is conducted by qualified trainers engaged by the school. The students go through rigorous training which will enable them to pick up important non-routine Mathematical concepts and be able to explain and apply their knowledge of the Mathematical concepts. It also aims to equip the students with the ability to respond critically and accurately to Mathematical questions both in class and in Math Olympiad competitions. Through this training, we hope the students will be able to demonstrate resilience and self-discipline when completing Mathematical problems. The training will help to prepare the students for competitions such as Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS), National Mathematics Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS), Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO) and Annual Mathlympics. The students have consistently done well in these competitions, with some pupils achieving the gold, silver and bronze awards.

ICAN PROGRAMME  

-----------------

### 

  

Core Belief That Every Student Can Learn Mathematics

To help our Primary 3 and 4 low progress learners, we have implemented the Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) Programme outside curriculum hours for selected students every week for two hours each lesson. The core belief of our ICAN programme is that all students can learn Mathematics. With this core belief as its cornerstone, this programme aims to level up the confidence and achievement of every low progress student and, in the process, build a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy in the learning of Mathematics. Our school has a group of trained ICAN teachers who are equipped with the knowledge, skills and resources to support the low progress learners in Mathematics.

### 

Bridging the Learning Gap in Mathematics

In ICAN, our teachers assess students’ prior knowledge and diagnose their learning gaps. With the understanding of what students know and do not know, our ICAN-trained teachers bridge the learning gaps, scaffold the learning of new knowledge, and provide reinforcement practice and cumulative review to help our students consolidate and remember Mathematical concepts.

  

Overcoming Language Difficulties

Our ICAN-trained teachers are also sensitive to the language difficulties that our low progress learners face. Thus, in our ICAN lessons, students are exposed to the mathematical meanings of English words and phrases which help our students comprehend word problems. Our teachers also facilitate the translation of these word problems into mathematical symbols and representations, and encourage students to use and practise the Mathematical language in class.

  

Motivating Students

To encourage Mathematical learning for our students in this programme, motivation is one of the key attributes in our ICAN lessons. Our teachers create a safe environment where making mistakes is part of the learning process, give positive feedback to encourage effort and progress, and provide ample opportunities to experience incremental success. More attention and focus are also given to individual mastery and self-improvement. Students in the ICAN programme are able to see how the Mathematical concepts that they learn can be applied to everyday life and this process motivates students to see meaning in their learning.

  

Improving Students' Retention of Knowledge

Students in our ICAN programme tend to face difficulties remembering what has been taught. They find it difficult to recall formulas and mathematical concepts. In particular, subtle differences between _more than_ and _less than_ tend to confuse low progress learners. In ICAN, these key concepts are explicitly highlighted to students so that they can better identify and recall what they have learned about these concepts. To promote retention, our teachers use graphic organisers, make connections with prior knowledge, use visual-aids as reminders of concepts, and provide practice and review to promote retention.

  

  

  

### 

LEARNING SUPPORT FOR MATHEMATICS (LSM)

### 

Timely Intervention to Bridge Learning Gaps

The Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) programme is designed to provide early intervention support in Mathematics to students who have not achieved an age-appropriate mathematical age when they enter Primary One. The goals of LSM are to level up and help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age and to equip students with the mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions so that they can learn Mathematics with their peers. Students are identified for this programme through the Early Numeracy Indicators Test which is administered at the beginning of Primary 1. Students identified for LSM programme are supported by qualified LSM teachers, Madam Norlia Safi’ee and Mr Ali Aziz. The LSM class-size is kept small, so that every student receives individual attention from the LSM teachers. The students are given much support and encouragement and are taught in a conducive and well-decorated classroom. The LSM teachers can help their students by ensuring that they experience success in learning Mathematics. In LSM, we also adopt the ICAN Intervention Framework which embraces 8 key principles of effective intervention, namely Routines and Norms, Diagnosis and Feedback, Confidence and Motivation, Key Ideas and their Connections, Explicit and Direct Instruction, Scaffolding and Progression, Communication and Reasoning, and Practice and Review.

### 

JWPS Learning Support Games Day

All Primary 1 and Primary 2 LSM students will have the opportunity to participate in creative and fun activities on our annual Learning Support Games Day. Students will work in groups to solve mathematical problems through logic, experiential learning and games. Through this event, our teachers hope to boost their interest in learning and promote character development through team building.

### 

LSM Cluster Games Day

In 2017, our Primary 2 LSM students took part in the Cluster LSM Games Day held at Clementi Primary School. The objectives of the event are to engage students in learning mathematical concepts in a fun and interactive way, and encourage teamwork among students through play. Through games, students gain greater confidence and develop a positive attitude towards Mathematics. Students are able to see how the mathematical concepts that they learn can be applied in daily life, thus making learning meaningful.

## MATHEMATICS WORKSHOPS FOR PARENTS

###  Enhancing Parent-School Partnership

<p style="text-align: justify;">To enhance parent-school partnership, Jurong West Primary School organised our annual Mathematics workshops for Primary One to Primary Four parents on 9 March 2018. We hope to better engage parents to support their child’s mathematical educational journey by bringing out the best in them. The workshop was conducted to encourage parent-child conversations and help parents reinforce mathematical concepts and routines that the child practise in school. The workshop also provided tips on how parents could guide their child in problem-solving using heuristics skills, relate Mathematics to real life situations and find ways to motivate their child. Feedback from the parents who attended the workshop was positive. They learnt new concepts and were better equipped to help their child at home. Through the strong collaboration between our school and parents, we can help our students discover their strengths and interests in Mathematics. </p>
