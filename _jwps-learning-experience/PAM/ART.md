### MISSION AND OBJECTIVES

**To provide students with skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to see, express and appreciate art in their daily lives.**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In seeing art, our students observe their surrounding closely, and analyse and reflect on their visual and other experiences. The focus will be on recording and interpreting as means towards developing students’ observation and visual inquiry. Students will be equipped with tools such as drawing to capture and reflect on their observations and experiences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In expressing art, our students generate ideas from what they see and explore ways to create and communicate through the use of various conventional and unconventional materials and tools, art forms and media. Students also experiment and innovate with visual elements, qualities of materials, tools and artistic processes in order to meet an artistic intention. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In appreciating art, our students acquire skills and use appropriate vocabulary to discuss and interpret artworks. Students deepen their understanding of Singapore through drawing inspirations from their environment, learning about artworks and artists from local and other cultures and context to make connections and understand the values of art in their lives and society.</p>
