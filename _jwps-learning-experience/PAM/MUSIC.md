Active listening developed from these processes will raise studentsâ€™ awareness in music and provide the basis to evaluate and describe the qualities of the music heard, giving them a platform to reflect and respond on their own compositions and those of peers and other musicians. With the essential skills, knowledge and learning experience, students will develop an understanding on the role of music in different cultures and its value. Hence, these will deepen their musical capacities and appreciation for music of various cultures.</p>
