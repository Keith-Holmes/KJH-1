### Aquatic Pond Community

<p style="text-align: justify;"> During the June holidays, the Primary 6 students went on learning journeys to the Science Centre. In one of the learning journeys, the students were taught field techniques to catch and observe a variety of aquatic organisms which make up the pond community. In the process, they learned about the relationships between organisms, such as food web, in the pond ecosystem. </p>
