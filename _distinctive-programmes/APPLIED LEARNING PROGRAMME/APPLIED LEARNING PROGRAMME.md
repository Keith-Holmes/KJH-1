## <span style = "color: #c81b1b"> <b>Art in Communication for Personal Excellence</b> </span>

Art in Communication for Personal Excellence seeks to extend our Primary 2 to Primary 5 students’ communication skills and learning by providing them with the opportunity to heighten their awareness of current affairs in their daily life from issues pertaining to racial harmony, outdoor education, to healthy living. Thereafter, the acquired knowledge is translated into purposeful action via digital story-telling, sharing of healthy recipe, interviewing protocol and newscasting.  
   
In so doing, we seek to raise confident communicators and creative individuals who are well-anchored on our school core values. To ensure the pervasiveness of our school niche, the school has deliberately infused it into our curriculums such as PAL, NE and IPW.  
   
To ensure a wholesome experience, both internal and external performing platforms such as The Art House, NLB, Frontier CC, recess interlude, school events, etc., will be created and sought to ensure that every student is able to share their experiences, stories, and opinions with different audiences. Students with talent, aptitude and interest will be given intensified exposure and training via our school Drama Club. The school also seeks to partner accreditation organisation such as LAMDA to provide certification of our students’ achievement.
