##### Lunar New Year Celebration and MT Fortnight Activities
<br>

Every year, JWPS welcomes the Lunar New Year with a series of fun-filled activities and a spectacular celebration in school. 
Teachers and students are charmed by the energetic stage performances like Wushu, Chinese Orchestra, acrobatic stunts, and many more. The highlight of this yearly event is the much anticipated performance by our very own JWPS Chinese Dance Club. 
Students also get to try their hands on a variety of classroom activities, like designing their own DIY Lunar New Year Cards and origami folding of the Zodiac Animal of the Year using red packets, so that they can send their sincere wishes to family and friends.
In line with MT Fortnight, our school also organises many hands-on activities as part of the recess interlude. These carefully curated activities and cultural programmes aim to deepen our students' sense of belonging by understanding their social roles in their respective cultures and promote the learning of MT languages in a fun and engaging way.
