##### Lunar New Year Celebration and MT Fortnight Activities
<br>

Every year, JWPS welcomes the Lunar New Year with a series of fun-filled activities and a spectacular celebration in school. 
Teachers and students are charmed by the energetic stage performances like Wushu, Chinese Orchestra, acrobatic stunts, and many more. The highlight of this yearly event is the much anticipated performance by our very own JWPS Chinese Dance Club. 
Students also get to try their hands on a variety of classroom activities, like designing their own DIY Lunar New Year Cards and origami folding of the Zodiac Animal of the Year using red packets, so that they can send their sincere wishes to family and friends.
In line with MT Fortnight, our school also organises many hands-on activities as part of the recess interlude. These carefully curated activities and cultural programmes aim to deepen our students' sense of belonging by understanding their social roles in their respective cultures and promote the learning of MT languages in a fun and engaging way.

##### Reading Mums

“Reading is the gateway skill that makes all other learning possible.”
By Barack Obama<br>

Our Reading Mums Programme caters to P1 and P2 students who need the extra support to help them gain confidence in Chinese. Through reading of Chinese story books and the use of word cards, students get to enjoy listening to stories and reinforce their abilities in recognising Chinese characters. During the sessions, students also get to play word games, sing-along to Chinese songs and even dance to Chinese music! 
At JWPS, we are grateful to have the strong support of a group of enthusiastic parent volunteers to help us conduct these sessions so that students can get to experience the joy of learning Chinese Language in a fun way. Together, we hope to instil the joy of learning and also the love for reading Chinese books in our students.
