##### MT Fortnight Activities for TL students

Every year, a series of Tamil cultural activities are conducted for our Tamil students as post-exam activities to create a deeper understanding about their culture and history. Conducted in Tamil by facilitators, these hands-on tasks also provide an immersive environment for students to learn and use the language.<br>

The lower block students did Agal Vilakku painting (lamp painting) while Rangoli kolam design were done by the middle block students. The P5 students on the other hand did copper tooling which is a form of Indian metal art. Students were engaged and had fun during these activities. <br>

##### Sinda Motivational Talk for P6 TL students

We collaborated with Sinda to conduct a virtual motivational talk for Primary 6 students on ‘Power Study Habits’ - tips to stay motivated and study smart. Students found it informative and helpful, especially during their crucial PSLE year. <br>

The speaker shared many useful tips that will help students with their time management and overcome the challenges they face.<br>
