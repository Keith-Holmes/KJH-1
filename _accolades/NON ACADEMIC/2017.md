### South West Eco-Skit Competition

Drama club participated in the South West Eco-Skit Competition organised by The National Environment Agency (South West Regional Office), South West Community Development Council, and Resorts World Sentosa S.E.A. Aquarium (RWS SEAA). Students were encouraged to form a team of not more than 10 students to produce an environmental-themed skit based on one of these topics - Litter-Free, 4Rs (Reduce, Re-use, Recycle and Refuse) or Energy Conservation - and how our actions on these issues ultimately affect the conservation of marine life. Students drew inspiration from how their visits to places like zoos and aquariums have inspired and motivated them to care more deeply about their individual responsibility to the environment.   

We are proud to announce that our club has been awarded the first place for this competition. We were invited to receive the award at the South West Clean & Green Singapore 2017 Launch Ceremony. The ceremony, which was hosted by the Mayor Ms Low Yen Ling, was held on 12th November at Jurong Point. The students who acted won for themselves a pair of annual passes each to the S.E.A. Aquarium. Congratulations!
