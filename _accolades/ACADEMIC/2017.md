### W3 Cluster Numero Challenge 2017

<p style="text-align: justify;">Eighteen of our Primary 4 students took part in the W3 Cluster Numero Challenge 2017 on 20 July 2017. We are pleased to announce that out of the top four teams shortlisted for the semi-finals, three teams were from Jurong West Primary School. After putting up a tough fight, our students, Lin Shiyan and Ngoh Sixuan, emerged as champions, making this the second consecutive year that our school has clinched the championship. </p>
