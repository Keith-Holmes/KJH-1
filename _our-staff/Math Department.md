Based on the Framework of the Singapore Mathematics Curriculum, we aim to :

*   facilitate students in the attainment of mathematical concepts and skills;
*   enhance students' learning through the explication of thinking and the development of metacognitive abilities; and
*   instil a love for Mathematics.
