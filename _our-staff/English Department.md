The English Department aims to equip our students with the skills to speak, read and write efficiently by the end of their Primary Education. Identified as the Niche of Excellence in Spoken English since 2007, all teachers in the school have been trained and are proficient in the teaching of good English to our students. In addition, the department also has regular programmes to hone the skills of our students in this core subject.
