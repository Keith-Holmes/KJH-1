CCAs are a key component of a balanced and holistic education where students can discover and explore their interest and talents in areas outside of the normal curriculum. In JWPS, CCAs are conducted outside of curriculum time over a period of 30 weeks.
Apart from bringing together students from different classes and profiles, the CCAs in JWPS serves as a platform for students to develop their characters and learn values and skills to become highly self-motivated, confident and well-balanced individuals. 
The soft skills and social-emotional competencies developed during CCAs sessions are essential in preparing students for the challenges they will face in the future.<br>

JWPS offers a total of 15 different CCAs, which can be grouped into 4 broad categories as listed below.
