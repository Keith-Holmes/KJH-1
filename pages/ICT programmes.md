IMDA Lab on Wheels

Students had the opportunity to try simple coding and work the Ozobot Robot under the guidance of our IMDA instructors. Designed to be experiential and engaging, the ICT activities conducted on the bus aim to spark students' interest in studying technology. Through this activity, students also developed logical thinking and problem-solving skills. They learned basic drag-and-drop coding to control their Ozobot Robot and eventually used it to solve trigonometry problems. The activity was well-received by students, with 98% of them finding the workshop fun and interesting, and they expressed their interest in trying out other coding activities at home by themselves. Overall, it was a meaningful and fruitful time for the students who attended the IMDA Lab on Wheels activity.
