For a holistic character and citizenship education, a school-based curriculum has been specially developed by the teachers for the students. This curriculum includes mandatory Form Teachers Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons, Character and Citizenship lessons (taught in Mother Tongue language), Assembly periods as well as Other School-Based Programmes.

 School values (THInKER) are explicitly taught through these various platforms too. Students then reflect on their learning experiences and develop critical thinking skills. Students consolidate their learning by penning down their reflections in the CCE Journal.

This is the CCE curriculum in JWPS.

Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)

The school believes that Form Teachers play a critical role in shaping the development of the young minds, thus, we take the weekly Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) seriously.   

 

FTGP is conducted from 8.00 a.m. to 8.30 a.m. every Friday for all students. During FTGP, Form Teachers provide quality interaction time. In addition to that, Form teachers equip students with social and emotional (SEL) competencies and the school THInKER values.  Mandatory lessons on Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) as well as Sexuality Education (for Primary 5 and 6) also form part of the FTGP lessons.

The school includes Zippy Friends programme into its FTGP lesson for the Lower Primary to help them manage the transition from preschool to primary schools and to equip them with practical socio-emotional skills. This is an evidence-based programme by the Health Promotion Board and supported by Ministry of Education Guidance Branch. The students learn 12 topics. The topics include: feelings, communication, friendship, conflict resolution, problem-solving, bullying, change and loss, and adapting to new situations.


Assembly Period

The school leverages on weekly Assembly period to inculcate values and instil citizenship in our students. Weekly Assembly programme takes place every Friday from 7.30 a.m. â€“ 8.00 a.m.

During Assembly, a variety of sharing sessions by our teachers, our alumni and external vendors are put together for our students. The highlight of the assembly programme would be the THInKER Values Talk by School Leaders. School leaders actively role model the inculcation of CCE by sharing stories related to the THInKER values, as well as the importance of having good character and sound moral values.

CCE (MTL) Lessons

CCE lessons in the Primary school are taught in Mother Tongue language. It focus on the inculcation of the 3RICH values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) through fun and meaningful activities. Through activities like story-telling, groupwork, role-playing and reflection, students learn to cultivate good social and communication sklls. These skills enable them to promote harmony and social cohesion in a multiracial and multi-religious society.

 

Values In Action (VIA)

The school believes that community involvement allows students to be active contributors as well as concerned citizens in Singapore. VIA is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education Education. It promotes active citizenry by involving students in meaningful and engaging activities planned by the school.

 

The school leverages the Head-Hands-Heart approach in championing its VIA effort. The school is mindful of the SE competencies which it seeks to engender through VIA. Keeping in mind age-activity compatibility, the VIA effort follows a progressive continuum from serving self, serving school, serving the community to serving the nation. Our We planned a variety of VIA programmes and collaborated with the departments in our school to provide opportunities for students to learn.
