##### Mobile Computer Labs

Our computer labs have gone mobile!

Conventionally, students were brought to the computer labs for ICT lessons but since 2017, we have made our computer labs mobile and we are now bringing computer labs to the students in the classrooms.

This initiative greatly reduces the time and hassle of bringing students from the classrooms to the computer labs, which could typically take ten to fifteen minutes.

ICT learning can now take place beyond the boundaries of the four walls of a lab. In fact, it can take place anywhere around the school! Let us take a look at some of the lessons conducted using our Mobile Computer Labs.
