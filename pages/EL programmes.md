APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP)

Art of Communication for Personal Excellence
The school believes in the potential of ALP to help it realise its school mission and vision. The school is cognisant of the growing demands and expectations of having students who are future ready and well anchored on sound moral values. As such, ALP is poised to bring about these two aspects which are also incidentally encapsulated in our mission statement.

Outcomes of ALP
To reaise confident communicators and creative individuals who are well anchored on the school core values and capable to lead self and others; and
To ensure the pervasiveness and sustainability of ALP via infusion into the school-based curriculum, namely PAL, NE and IPW.
In line with the GiFT approach in student development, the school has been very focused and comprehensive in its first tier of General student development via ALP. In the area of Focused Training, the school will further streamline its processes in identifying the potential students for Tier 2 development. In the case of Talent management, the school will be looking at possible platforms for the students to be further stretched in their potential via school ambassadorship.


DIGITAL STORYTELLING (DST)

Alignment with the MOE English Syllabus
DST was launched in response to the fast-changing and multi-faceted way of learning in the educational landscape. The programme was aligned to the school’s vision and mission and ICT was employed extensively. To quote Michael Fullen, “Pedagogy is the driver. Technology is the accelerator." We hope to deepen and enhance the writing processes of the students, as well as make writing a pleasurable experience for them. DST is not an add-on. Instead, it is meant as a complement to the school's STELLAR writing programme in alignment with the MOE English Syllabus.

Through DST, the school hopes to enhance competencies across many domains, and expose teachers and students to the possibilities of using Web2.0 tools for teaching and learning. A number of teaching periods were allocated to DST in the Primary 3 English curriculum. Through DST, our students learnt to use tools such as Google Slides, Google Documents, Linoit and PowerPoint to write and share about their experiences. As a form of self-directed learning, students were taught features of recount writing and encouraged to create their own digital stories.
