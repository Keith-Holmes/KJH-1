### Aquatic Pond Community

<p style="text-align: justify;"> During the June holidays, the Primary 6 students went on learning journeys to the Science Centre. In one of the learning journeys, the students were taught field techniques to catch and observe a variety of aquatic organisms which make up the pond community. In the process, they learned about the relationships between organisms, such as food web, in the pond ecosystem. </p>

### Leaf Litter Community

<p style="text-align: justify;"> During their learning journey to learn about the leaf litter community, the Primary 6 students investigated the organisms responsible for the decay and breakdown of plant and animal matter in the leaf litter community. This learning journey provides the students with an opportunity to sharpen their skills in finding and observing the animals that they had caught, as well as gain an understanding of how recycling of nutrients works in nature. </p>
